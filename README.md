Just a small repo to keep track of my progression on this AoC

# Recap Day by Day

## Day 1
Nothing special, it was pretty easy, I just had to remember how to parse files in c++

## Day 2

Don't had a lot of time today. I made a functionnal version for the part 1, but I lost it, and I didn't have the time to finish part 2, so I will not push anything today
